The STL to ASCII Generator is a lightweight and easy way to convert an STL file (3D model) into an ASCII image. Just upload your STL file and experiment with the settings to create your ASCII masterpiece! 

You can enter your own custom text to change the characters used in the ASCII image, and reset them to the default character set: ' .:-+*=%@#'

Future Development:

- [x] Copy ASCII image to clipboard (thanks [donno2048](https://github.com/donno2048)!)
- [X] Change lighting orientation (thanks [zumatt](https://github.com/zumatt)!)
- [X] Add screenshot on mobile
