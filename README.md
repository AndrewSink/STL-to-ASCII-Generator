UPDATE: Huge thanks to [Oskitone](https://github.com/oskitone) for their help in adding a text export option!

The STL to ASCII Generator is a lightweight and easy way to convert an STL file (3D model) into an ASCII image. Just upload your STL file and select a character set to generate the image. 


You can enter your own custom text to change the characters used in the ASCII image, and reset them to the default character set: ' .:-+*=%@#'


Future Development:

- [ ] Change lighting orientation
- [ ] Add screenshot on mobile
